<!--I have decided to use divs instead of section to separate all my feilds because I hope to make this document into a form. However i tought it would be pointless to make an actual form because i would have nowhere to post the form to as this is a html exclusive assignment. a suitable alternative would have been to v=create an ordered list-->
